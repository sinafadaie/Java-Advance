for thread safe code we have some strategies:
1.Confinement
2.Immutability
3.Synchronization
4.Atomic-objects
5.partitioning

Confinement:
just simply don't share data across threads!
restrict or confine each thread to its data

Immutability:
use immutable obj like string
in this case threads just can read from these objects

Synchronization:
prevent multiple threads from accessing the same object concurrently.
we synchronize or coordinate the access to an object across different threads
we do that using "LOCKS"
only one thread can execute that part of the code
other threads have to wait!
its create sequence inside a parallel!
Synchronization is challenging and error prone!
it can create dead locks (two thread wait for each other)
dead locks cause our app be crash
Synchronization is not good, avoid it as much as possible
********everywhere see "synchronized", it means act like "Locking"***********

Atomic-objects:
Atomic classes like AtomicInteger
allow us achieve thread safety without locks
single operation never create issue!
these class can handle multiple operation like single operation

partitioning:
partitioning data into segments that can be accessed concurrently.
java provides a number of collection classes that support concurrency using partitioning.
multiple threads can access a collection object simultaneously
but only one thread at a time can access a segment in that collection.
its like divide an object to smaller pieces!
