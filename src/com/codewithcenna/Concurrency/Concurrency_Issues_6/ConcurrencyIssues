  in all pre examples, threads have been isolated from each other.
  but in many cases, our threads may modify shared resources
  when multiple threads access to a same object, we have issues!
  imagine we have an object that report all bytes we downloaded.
  ------------------
  concurrency problem:
  1.race condition
  2.visibility problem

  race condition:
  when multiple threads wants modify same object at same time
  its like they have race with each other

  visibility problem:
  one thread change the shared data,
  but the changes are not visible to other threads
  different threads have different view of tha data!

  -----------------
  if threads just read shared data, we are fine.
  but if at least one of them
  can modify data we have issues.(visibility problem).

  Thread-Safe code:
  code that can be safely executed by many threads in parallel
