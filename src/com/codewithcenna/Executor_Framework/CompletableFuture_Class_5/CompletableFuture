Class CompletableFuture <T>
this class implement two interface:
Future<T> Interface
CompletionStage<T> Interface
so every CompletableFuture is a kind of future
-----------------------
CompletionStage:
A stage of possibly "asynchronous" computation.
what it means:
in real world, asynchronous operation involves many steps.
we call an API to get some data(step 1)
then transfer the result to another data structure (step 2)
write that data to data base (step 3)

this interface represent
a stage of an asynchronous operation and gives us a bunch of
methods to combining and composing these steps in a "declarative" way
like we used declarative methods on streams.
I think its create a pipeline for doing these steps
and instead this multiple steps, we have a asynchronous pipeline
--------------------------
summary:
so look at this class like a pipeline that have complex step inside,
and this pipeline act asynchronous (don't block other thread),
and its future type (the value can catch in future)
--------------------------
Singleton design pattern:
A Singleton is a design pattern that ensures a class has only
one instance during the lifetime of an application
and provides a global access point to that instance.
The instance is created once
The same instance is reused everywhere.
if you create new instance, its return that old instance
