when we create a CompletableFuture
we can act it like a stream of CompletableFuture object
(transfer CompletableFuture object through this stream)
with this concept,we can build recipe for our asynchronous operations

we can consume the inside value by thenAccept
(the stream continue, its return old CompletableFuture object)
it means the CompletableFuture object is  accessible after "thenAccept"
-----------------------------
we can just do something among this stream
by thenRun
(the stream continue, its return old CompletableFuture object)
it means the CompletableFuture object is  accessible after "thenRun"
-----------------------------
we can convert or manipulate the CompletableFuture object
by "thenApply"
(the stream continue with new CompletableFuture object )
-----------------------------
we can just replace our CompletableFuture object to
a new CompletableFuture object by "thenCompose"
It's useful for start a depended task upon completion another task
(we need the result of pre task, in thenRun we don't need the result)
(like we want find playlist by customerId,we should find email first)
(the stream continue with new CompletableFuture object )
