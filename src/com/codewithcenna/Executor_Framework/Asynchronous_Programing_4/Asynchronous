in pre lesson, we saw future.get()
was a blocking method (block main thread)
main thread should be wait until the result is ready.
----------
although we use multiple thread,
one of the thread is pending on another thread
its bad! this is not the purpose of multi threading.
----------
if we had a mobile or desktop app
and our main thread wait like this,
its not able to respond to UI event like clicks,...
our app is going to freeze!
----------
we should write code in a non-blocking way
this way called Asynchronous programing.
Asynchronous is fancy computer science term :)
it just simply means non-blocking!
-----------
java introduce some tools in 2014
to write code in synchronous way
