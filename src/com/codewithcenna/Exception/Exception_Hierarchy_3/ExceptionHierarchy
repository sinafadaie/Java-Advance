its define common characteristics for all exceptions and errors
like stack trace and error massage (so all exceptions and error have stack trace and error massage)

below throwable class
we have
1.Exception class (parent of checked and unchecked exception)
2.Error Class (for external error)

RuntimeException
if an exception derived from the runtime exception, its consider an unchecked exception
otherwise, its a checked exception
