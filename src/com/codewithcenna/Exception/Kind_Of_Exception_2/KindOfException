we have three type exception in java
1.checked exception
2.unchecked exception(run time exception)
3.error

1.checked exception:
the exception, the developers should anticipate and handle properly.
for example when you read from a file in java
var reader = new FileReader("file.txt")
you should handle that maybe there is not such a file,
if you don't handle you have compile time error (unhandled exception )
java compiler enforce to handle this error
its called checked, because they get checked at compile time

2.unchecked exception:
they occur because of programing errors.
NullPointerException is unchecked exception
ArithmeticException when something divide by zero
illegalArgumentException when the argument was not accepted
indexOutOfBoundsException when use invalid index
illegalStateException when call method but the underling object is not in the right state

3.error
it is not refer to our code or application
its because of something external
stack overflow error
out of memory error
