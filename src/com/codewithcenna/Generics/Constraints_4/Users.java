//comparable is a interface
//we can implements many of interfaces in a single class
//(it was the hole that we can abuse interfaces to multiple inheritance )
//but we should implement all of the methods in the interface
//except the method is a default method in interface(we saw bad feature in java)
//or our class is abstract(then the child should implement them)
//-------------------------
//we can implement a interface
//in a multiple classes
//its the main idea of interfaces
//-------------------------
//some times we extend a interface to the other
//its clear that we dont need implement the methods
//it just inheritance
//and a interface can inherit from multiple interfaces
